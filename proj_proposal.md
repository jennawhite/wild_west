**The Question: Can you predict the rental price of a 1 bedroom based on the venture capital raised in that city?**

Data to use:  
* [Zillow Rental Indices]
* [Crunchbase Funding Data]

There are a lot of ongoing discussions around how tech investment can change the landscape of a city - especially concerning housing affordability. As a 3x start-up employee, I'm really interested in exploring if there is a direct effect between venture money coming into a city economy and the cost of housing.
