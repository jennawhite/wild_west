She was a Hound/Terrier mutt that I had rescued after someone ""threw her from a car"" in a parking lot of a Kmart store. She was only about 3 months old then and quite the little hellion as a puppy. I quickly learned that having a puppy requires a lifetime of patience and that the unconditional love that they give in return is more than worth it. As she grew into a very sweet and loyal pup to myself and most humans, I also noticed that she grew increasingly unpleasant with other dogs. Trying everything to help decrease her reactivity to other dogs and having nothing help definitely made things hard.

I grew up in rural areas in the Midwest, and we always had at least one family dog of varying breeds.  When I became an adult, I got a black lab puppy from my sister, who had rescued its mother while it was pregnant.  I became very interested in dog training, reading any books I could get my hands on and applying their techniques.  My lab, Asia, became the gentlest, most well-trained dog most people had ever met.  We lost her at age 13;  since then, we have always had a lab as a family pet and we have taken care of countless other breeds.

As a child my family taught me that animal companions are very therapeutic. My first real companion was Angel, a beautiful boxer that would wag not only her tail, but her entire backside to show how happy she was to see you.  She became very ill with parvo when she was about two years old and was nursed back to health by myself and my mother.  Angel became very attached to my mother and bonded with her through the illness.  Once she recovered she spent more time with my mother than before and adored dearly. We have had several family companions growing up, ones that I have loved dearly, but once I moved out I had to leave them at home with my family. rOver the years I have had two beautiful children and became a full-time single mother and student, so life never slowed or calmed down enough for me to feel like I could take on raising anything more than my children.

The story about Chichi is a special one.  Chichi actually belonged to the neighbors but would come to visit and play with Eddie and Cassie quite often.  One time when Chichi came over they notice his neck was very red and irrated.  It turned out it was a rubber band that one of the neighbor kids had wrapped around his neck.  My family immediately took Chichi to the vet. My family's vet was so kind and didn't even charge us but he told the family that owned chichi if they didn't sign Chichi over to my family he would bring animal cruelty charges against them.

Dogs, and animals in general, have been a huge part of my life since I was young and all of my careers choices have been in the animal field. When I was in middle school I started volunteering for a restoration ranch who rescued farm animals and rehabilitated them and either adopted them out or housed them for life. At Serenity Restoration Ranch, I got a lot of hands on experience with all kinds of animals like rabbits, chickens, ducks, goats, horses, pigs, llamas, and sheep. After volunteering for awhile, I started working for their mobile petting zoo and pony party business. Soon after I started volunteering for the Regional Animal Services of King County where I have been volunteering ever since! After that I have worked at a boarding kennel and am now currently working at Mud Bay, a all natural and holistic pet store where I get to enjoy all the dogs and cats that come in and get to work with customers, just like you, to help them with their animals everyday needs.

When I was a kid I was always trying to sneak a dog I found without a home. When I was in grade school (and now) all I read about was dogs, breeds, behaviors, sizes, and training methods. I read about how they think how they play even how their brains work! I had dogs growing up and currently my husband and I adopted our new family member Chief! He's an aspca rescue and the sweetest boy I have met! I do a lot of training with Chief. He plays hide n seek and closes doors and more! I have always been able to connect with animals (dogs especially) better than with my peers. My dog is always there for me, he doesn't judge, he is always ecstatic to see me, he protects me, he respects me and always has my back. In fact he's laying right by my feet now!

I was bringing stray dogs home into a cramped apartment and my Mom always got rid of them in a couple of days.  Then our neighbors/friends got a German Shepard and he was my best friend. I had my first dog when I became a student and since that time I had different dogs all my life till October 2014.  My last dog Shandy passed away due to an old age and cancer.  I have also handled dogs and puppies for my friends and neighbors in their absence.  I was interested in dog's psychology and read extensively about research in that field.,1,f,1/1/43,0,4.9,20,5,0,100,216,1,0,,1,1997511,10/10/16,1,,,0,0,,,,,,,,

We got her from a breeder who had been breeding them in the U.S. for a long time. Now they are called Carolina Dogs I believe? Anyway, Mikko was diagnosed with Lukemia at a very young age. I only got to spend 2 years with her before she passed. My brother and mom were allergic to most dog breeds, so after Mikko passed we got smaller breeds. My parents raised me to treat all animals with love and respect. Our oldest dog, whom we got after Mikko's passing) just passed from natural causes...he lived to be 14 years old.

After graduating about a year ago, I joined a dog-walking agency in Manhattan where Ive had experience walking and caring for dogs of all sizes and temperaments, including an adorable senior Beagle with special needs. My duties include walking, feeding, and bathing the dogs as well as daily written and verbal communication with owners.

I didn't have a dog until I was 13 but I wanted one so badly that I spent hours a day researching different types of dogs. That led me into researching dog behavior and training. When I still didn't have a dog, I decided that the next best thing would be to ""borrow"" other people's dogs and start my own dog sitting business. A year later I met my dog for the first time, and  it was one of the happiest moments of my life. His little puppy body was underweight and malnourished, and at the time, he could only use three of his legs. Eventually with plenty of exercise and love as therapy, he eventually gained more and more use of his 4th leg. Now you can't even tell a difference. Just recently I decided to intern at an animal hospital where I work with all kinds of different dogs and the dog trainer there. Everyday I am around dogs, and I couldn't be happier.

It took awhile to find another great dog, but we found her in Edo, a Blue Heeler. She was a bundle of energy on legs like little springs! She was with us until life circumstances changed and we could no longer have dogs. Once I moved out and was on my own, I was excited to get a smaller dog, perfect for an apartment. Luckily, I found him in April, 2005, when I met my pug, Artoo! We have been on many adventures and he is a hilarious character. He loves to show off his pink Nylabone whenever I come home, just in case I forgot how supremely awesome it is.

My husband and I adopted our first dog (Paris) in 2001 on a camping trip. A family was giving away 5 puppies at Slim's Market in Naches.  From that point, our lives have not been the same - in a good way.  A few years later, we adopted a choc lab (Sadie) from my mom who could no longer care for her.  Paris & Sadie loved each other.  We had 4 love filled years with Sadie before she passed from mast cell cancer in 2007.  Paris passed at 12 y/o in May 2013.  Aside from losing my dad, I've not felt such losses in my life.  We now have Lily (choc lab) & Otis (Catahoula mix) and happy to say we're continuing with the dog love in this house.  Dogs are my heart love.  I can't go anywhere without gravitating to dogs.rrOtis is a bit possessive of me and his home.  Although we are working to socialize him more, we do not board dogs in our home.

Growing up we had large dogs.  My husband and I raised our first baby from a puppy.  She was a tan colored husky that was part of our family for 15 years.  Her name was Puppy.  We rescued Winnie about 4 months after loosing Puppy. She was almost 2 and had been at more than one shelter in her short life.  We could not let her live another day without a family.  She loves to sit and cuddle.   About a year later I was asked by my sister in law who was fostering dogs to watch Matilda for a couple of hours.  Our dear sweet Matilda had been taken from her Momma too early and dropped off at a shelter in Oakland.  She does not always know that she is a dog and definitely acts like the baby of the family.  We see all dogs as part of a family and they will be treated that way in our home.,1,,,1,4.87,77,0,-1,70,57504,1,0,"4/17/16, # 608387  -  Sitter was bitten 3 times by RD and RD was re-homed.
